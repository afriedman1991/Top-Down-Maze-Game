# Top-Down-Maze-Game
A spooky top-down maze game

The tutorial I followed can be found here: https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner

To test the game, UnityHub version 2.32 and Unity version 2019.3.13f1 are required.

Pull down the repository to your preferred directory, and open UnityHub. Click on the "ADD" button in UnityHub and find the project in the directory you saved it. Once the project is added, click on it in UnityHub and the Unity Editor will open up. At the top of the editor, click the play button and you'll be able to test the game.
